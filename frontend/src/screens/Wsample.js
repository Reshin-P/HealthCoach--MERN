It's common to come back from an extended workout break and want to hit the ground running at your previous intensity to make up for lost time. However, that could increase the risk of injury and/or burnout. FB Reboot is designed to build a solid foundation of strength, cardio, and fundamental movement to get your body and mind back in the rhythm of exercising consistently. We include a combination of level 2 and 3 workouts.",
